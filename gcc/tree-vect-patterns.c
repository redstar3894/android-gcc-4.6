     sum_0 = phi <init, sum_1>

     S5  prod = x_T * y_T;
     [S6  prod = (TYPE2) prod;  #optional]
     S7  sum_1 = prod + sum_0;

   where 'TYPE1' is exactly double the size of type 'type', and 'TYPE2' is the
   same size of 'TYPE1' or bigger. This is a special case of a reduction
   computation.

   Input:

   * STMTS: Contains a stmt from which the pattern search begins.  In the
   example, when this function is called with S7, the pattern {S3,S4,S5,S6,S7}
   will be detected.

   Output:

   * TYPE_IN: The type of the input arguments to the pattern.

   * TYPE_OUT: The type of the output  of this pattern.

   * Return value: A new stmt that will be used to replace the sequence of
   stmts that constitute the pattern. In this case it will be:
        WIDEN_DOT_PRODUCT <x_t, y_t, sum_0>

   Note: The dot-prod idiom is a widening reduction pattern that is
         vectorized without preserving all the intermediate results. It
         produces only N/2 (widened) results (by summing up pairs of
         intermediate results) rather than all N results.  Therefore, we
         cannot allow this pattern when we want to get all the results and in
         the correct order (as is the case when this computation is in an
         inner-loop nested in an outer-loop that us being vectorized).  */

   A special case of multiplication by constants is when 'TYPE' is 4 times
   bigger than 'type', but CONST fits an intermediate type 2 times smaller
   than 'TYPE'.  In that case we create an additional pattern stmt for S3
   to create a variable of the intermediate type, and perform widen-mult
   on the intermediate type as well:

     type a_t;

     S5  prod_T = a_T * CONST;
           '--> prod_T' = a_it w* CONST;

   Input/Output:

   * STMTS: Contains a stmt from which the pattern search begins.  In the
   example, when this function is called with S5, the pattern {S3,S4,S5,(S6)}
   is detected.  In case of unsigned widen-mult, the original stmt (S5) is
   replaced with S6 in STMTS.  In case of multiplication by a constant
   of an intermediate type (the last case above), STMTS also contains S3
   (inserted before S5).

   Output:

   * TYPE_IN: The type of the input arguments to the pattern.

   * TYPE_OUT: The type of the output of this pattern.

   * Return value: A new stmt that will be used to replace the sequence of
   stmts that constitute the pattern.  In this case it will be:

   Say the sequence {S1,S2,S3,S4} was detected as a pattern that can be
   represented by a single stmt.  We then:
   - create a new stmt S6 equivalent to the pattern (the stmt is not
     inserted into the code)
   - fill in the STMT_VINFO fields as follows:

                                  in_pattern_p  related_stmt    vec_stmt
         S1: a_i = ....                 -       -               -
         S2: a_2 = ..use(a_i)..         -       -               -
         S3: a_1 = ..use(a_2)..         -       -               -
         S4: a_0 = ..use(a_1)..         true    S6              -
          '---> S6: a_new = ....        -       S4              -
         S5: ... = ..use(a_0)..         -       -               -

   (the last stmt in the pattern (S4) and the new pattern stmt (S6) point
   to each other through the RELATED_STMT field).

   S6 will be marked as relevant in vect_mark_stmts_to_be_vectorized instead
   of S4 because it will replace all its uses.  Stmts {S1,S2,S3} will
   remain irrelevant unless used by stmts other than S4.

   If vectorization succeeds, vect_transform_stmt will skip over {S1,S2,S3}
   (because they are marked as irrelevant).  It will vectorize S6, and record
   a pointer to the new vector stmt VS6 from S6 (as usual).
   S4 will be skipped, and S5 will be vectorized as usual:

                                  in_pattern_p  related_stmt    vec_stmt
         S1: a_i = ....                 -       -               -
         S2: a_2 = ..use(a_i)..         -       -               -
         S3: a_1 = ..use(a_2)..         -       -               -
       > VS6: va_new = ....             -       -               -
         S4: a_0 = ..use(a_1)..         true    S6              VS6
          '---> S6: a_new = ....        -       S4              VS6
       > VS5: ... = ..vuse(va_new)..    -       -               -
         S5: ... = ..use(a_0)..         -       -               -

   DCE could then get rid of {S1,S2,S3,S4,S5} (if their defs are not used
   elsewhere), and we'll end up with:

        VS6: va_new = ....
        VS5: ... = ..vuse(va_new)..  

   In case of more than one pattern statements, e.g., widen-mult with
   intermediate type:

     S1  a_t = ;
     S2  a_T = (TYPE) a_t;
           '--> S3: a_it = (interm_type) a_t;
     S4  prod_T = a_T * CONST;
           '--> S5: prod_T' = a_it w* CONST;
   
   there may be other users of a_T outside the pattern. In that case S2 will
   be marked as relevant (as well as S3), and both S2 and S3 will be analyzed
   and vectorized.  The vector stmt VS2 will be recorded in S2, and VS3 will
   be recorded in S3.  */
